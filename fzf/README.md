# Install fzf

Clone their [Git repo](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation) and run their installer.
Check same repo if the instructions below don't work.


```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git
cd fzf
./install
```

Once `fzf` has been installed, then you can either add the path to the `bin/` folder inside the repo folder,
or copy the built binary to somewhere like `usr/local/bin`.
